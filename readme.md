# Machine Learning Algorithms  
Using Jupyter notebooks, these files seek to give a literate programming approach to some basic machine learning models. The goal of each of the files is to implement the respective machine learning model with limited use of external libraries.  

## Specific Models  
Below is a brief summary of the models which have been implemented. The individual notebooks provide greater detail regarding the specifics.  

### [Gradient descent](GradientDescent.ipynb)  
- Creates a user-defined gradient descent function  
- Implements gradient descent function to fit linear, multi-variable data and non-linear, single-variable data  
- Plots gradient descent function over data to visually compare  

### [Logistic Regression]()
